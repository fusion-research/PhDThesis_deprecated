Here I briefly report the results for the optimisation experiments of the \textit{Needed} policy.
I followed the same procedure explained in Sec.~\ref{sec:7_7a_opt} for the \textit{Hybrid} return policy. As in that case, the genetic algorithm is able to largely optimise the solution, as reported in figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_optimized_metrics_needed}, with \textit{local searches} stuck in local minima. 
In particular, for the walked distance (figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_wwd_Needed}), the genetic algorithm is able lower it from 136\,m to 45\,m at 13\% of zones. Still, it doesn't reach the performance of the \textit{Hybrid} policy, i.e., 30\,m at 13\% of zones.

Figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_opt_needed} reports the other user discomfort metrics. The two optimisation algorithms reduce the charge events (Fig~\ref{fig:7_7a_recharge_Needed}).
%The \textit{Genetic} algorithm shows the best performance with a probability the lowest probability of 6\% when 13\% of the zones are equipped with charging stations. 
Since the car are recharged less frequently with respect to the \textit{Hybrid} policy it is interesting to evaluate the impact on the \textit{Average Stage of Charge}. figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_asoc_Needed} reports this metric for the different placement algorithms.  As we expected, the \textit{Average Stage of Charge} is lower with respect to the \textit{Hybrid policy}. Interestingly, for both optimized solutions this value saturate almost immediately at 55\% in the feasible region.
% Moreover, despite in figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_recharge_Needed} we saw that in the optimized solutions we recharge less frequent the car, 
However,  the average state of charge (figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_asoc_Needed}) is always higher in the optimised solutions than in the \textit{Num parking} configuration. This further demonstrates that a smarter placement allows the car to get more energy for each charge.
%with an opposite trend with respect to Fig~\ref{fig:7_7a_recharge_Hybrid},
%Finally, we evaluate the users discomfort metrics in terms of rerouting probability and the average distance an user has to walk when rerouted.
Figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_reroute_Needed} reports the re-routing percentage for the different algorithms. As expected, the values are larger than with the \textit{Hybrid} policy, since no opportunistic charge is performed. 
This different is particularly evident when a few charging stations are present e.g., with 5\% of charging stations the rerouting are 14\% for the \textit{Num parking} heuristic, 14\% for the \textit{Local search}, and 6\% for the \textit{Genetic} algorithm. 
However, the genetic algorithm is able to quickly reach a small value of re-routings, hence better exploiting every charge possibility. 
%without showing further improvements while increasing the percentage of charging stations applied. 
Finally, I analyse the distance a user has to walk when rerouted (Figure~\ref{fig:7_7a_awd_Needed}). Here, with respect to the \textit{Hybrid} policy case, the \textit{local search} shows larger deviations from the \textit{Num parking}. The genetic algorithm reaches values of about 800\,m, even below the ones reached with the \textit{Hybrid} policy.

In conclusion, within this range of zones equipped with charging stations, a smart placement with the \textit{Needed} policy approaches the \textit{Hybrid} policy results.  
%Therefore, anche se gli utenti non sono tutti collaborativi, il sistema va bene lo stesso se ottimizzato.
