The third and final step is the data analysis phase in which analytics modules query the MongoDB and obtain statistics. We rely on the Python programming language with Pandas and the GeoPandas as libraries to deal with the data, and the zoning division of Turin and the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for the spatial analyis. We choose Python as it offer a large number of  libraries that allow us to easily interact with the different databases like the Turin zoning, GIS, maps and MongoDB. In particular the usage of GeoPandas, Turin zoning, and GIS in synergy allow us to easily perform geographic analysis and split the city in many areas (or districts) of any possible shapes.
